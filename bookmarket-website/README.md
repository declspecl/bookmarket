# bookmarket-website

This is the package containing all the frontend UI code.
It is made in React.js using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

### Node.js

To run this locally, you will need to install Node.js, a way to run JavaScript on your machine.
It can be installed [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
You also need to install `npm` which is the Node.js package manager.
If you downloaded from the link above, you should already have it.
Otherwise, you'll need to google how to.

### IDE

I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code for web stuff.
It can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## How to run

First, run the `npm install` command to download all the required packages.
Then run the `npm run dev` command to run the local frontend server on your computer.
It will print out a URL on `localhost` that you can navigate to in order to view the website.
To generate the final static files, run `npm run build`
